# PROJECT NAME

- set your version badge or shields with shields.io
- you can reference this question : [How can I use shields.io](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62726873/with-shields-io-how-to-set-specific-version-of-badge)
  <!-- you can set badge below, about your dependecies -->
  three way of making badge

1. Your Badge (static version)
2. inject the lastest version of your npm package automatically from the npm servers
3. create badges for your project dependencies
<!-- badge here -->

- latest verion of next
  ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/next?label=next&style=for-the-badge)

- my dependency from package.json
  ![GitHub package.json dependency version (prod)](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/dependency-version/devstefancho/readme-template/next?style=for-the-badge)

- in this particular case you should use GitHub package.json dependency version (subfolder of monorepo). It is exactly the same as the last one but in filename section you can specify the directory of your package.json
  <!-- your link address -->
  :link: [site name](url)

<!-- shortcut links -->
